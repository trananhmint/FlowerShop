      Sunflowers are bright, cheerful flowers with large yellow petals
      surrounding a dark center, often associated with warmth and positivity.
      They can grow quite tall, reaching heights of several feet, and their
      heads turn to follow the sun throughout the day.
      <br />
      To keep cut sunflowers fresh:
      <br />
      <br />
      <p>
        <span>Trim the Stems:</span>
        Cut about an inch off the bottom of the stems at an angle. This helps
        the flowers absorb water more easily.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span>emove Leaves:</span>R Strip any leaves that will be submerged in
        water to prevent rot.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span>Use Clean Water:</span>
        Fill a clean vase with fresh, cool water. Consider adding floral
        preservative if you have it.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span>Keep Cool:</span>
        Place the vase in a cool area, away from direct sunlight and heat
        sources.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span>Change Water Regularly:</span> Refresh the water every couple of
        days and re-trim the stems to prolong their freshness.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span>Monitor for Wilting:</span>
        Remove any wilted petals or leaves to maintain the overall appearance
        and health of the arrangement.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        With proper care, sunflowers can brighten your space for a week or more!
      </p>
